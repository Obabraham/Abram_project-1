RECOMMENDATIONS

1.       Reduce reliance on government contracts. Strengthen small business & enterprise market penetration.

2.       Optimize paseo’s cost structure, negotiate supplier costs or explore alternatives to lower production expenses.

3.       Focus on high-margin products (VTT & VELO). Shift marketing and promotions towards these products.

4.       Capitalize on seasonal demand. Boost inventory and promotions in October & December.

5.       Expand into the Mexican market. Develop market-specific strategies and distribution networks.

6.       Improve performance in enterprise, midmarket & channel partner segments. Conduct targeted market research and create customized sales strategies.

7.       The high revenue generation shows a massive increase of sales and improvement in good marketing strategy. Continue the effective marketing strategies to sustain the profitability growth

8.       The spikes in June, September, November, October, and December suggest seasonal demand or production capacity changes. Identify factors influencing these fluctuations. Also, Strategies such as promotions, discounts, or improved marketing can be applied in months with lower counts (January–May, July–August)

9.       Since Paseo has the highest COGS, and highest revenue to justify the cost.  We may also consider adopting cost-cutting strategies to reduce the cost. Montana and Carretera have the lowest COGS, they also have lower sales volumes, marketing and promotional strategies should be considered to improve their performance
